Assignment Approach:
Before Doing This Assignment Firstly We Read The Documentation Of The SCKIT-LEARN And Researched About The Requirments Given In Our Assingment

Problems Faced:
One Of The Main Problem Was That Our Dataset Had Negative Values And Due To This Our Model Was Not Accepting Those Values So We Tried Different Solutions like decomposition-NMF 
And preprocessing.MinMaxScaler But These Approches Didn't Worked So We Used abs() Function For The Negative Values Conversion Into Postive
Refrences Used:
